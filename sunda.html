                    The history of Turkey includes the history of both Anatolia (the Asian part of Turkey) and Eastern Thrace (the European part of Turkey).
                    These two regions came under the control of the Roman Empire in the second century BC, eventually becoming the core of the Byzantine Empire.

                    From the time when parts of what is now Turkey were conquered by the Seljuq dynasty,
                    the history of Turkey spans the medieval history of the Seljuk Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Republic of Turkey since the 1920s.
